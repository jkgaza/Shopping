/**@todo Create a simple shopping cart application with JavaScript
 * 
 * Do not use Array.push, Array.pop Array.splice, Array.unshift, Array.shift
 * Use spread operator and slice
 * 
 * @todo Make shoppingcart.js  which will contain all of the code.
    ● Initialize an empty array in a variable called shoppingCart.
    ● Initialize an array of objects (5 at minimum) in a variable called itemList.
        ○ This array will not be altered. It is here for a future exercise.
        ○ Each object in the list must have the following properties:
            i.name
            ii.price
    ● Declare four functions:
        ○ addItem(itemName, itemPrice)
            i.Adds a new object to the shoppingCart array. 
        ○ removeItem(itemName)
            i.Removes an object from the shoppingCart array. This method uses Array.findIndex().
        ○ editItem()
            i.Edits an object in the shoppingCart array. This method uses Array.findIndex(). 
        ○ printTotal()
            i.Prints the total of all items from the shoppingCart array. 
                This includes the a 6% tax. Do not use a for loop. Use a for..of loop .
